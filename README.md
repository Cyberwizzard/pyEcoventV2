# pyEcovent

Python3 library for single-room energy recovery ventilators from Vents / Blauberg / Flexit

## Install
	pip3 install pyEcovent

## Example usage
	Example will follow

## Intended usage
The intended usage of this library is to include ventilation fans from Vents / Blauberg / Flexit in <https://www.home-assistant.io/>

## Tested fans 
This library has only been tested on [Twinfresh Expert RW1-50](http://vents-us.com/item/5262/VENTS_TwinFresh_Expert_RW1-50-2_Wi-Fi/)

There are fans from Blauberg and Flexit that are identical and should work, but I have not verified that.
